# What is this?

Here you will find the source for my Beat Saber map "you", which was released alongside TotalBS' "[Extra Sensory 2](link coming soon)" event.

# Why is it here?

I am making the source of this map public so that others can study how it works. However, I still hold the rights to all of the assets created by me (which is 99% of them!).

I do not want my work being copy-pasted into other projects and potentially being profited off of. I would really rather that you use it transformatively or as a reference.

Please respect this!
